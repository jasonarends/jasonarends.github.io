<div style="clear: both;">the recipe works out like this:</div>
<ul>
<li>1 c active sourdough starter</li>
<li>6.5 c bread flour</li>
<li>1 c spicy V8</li>
<li>1.25 c water</li>
<li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1 Tbsp garlic salt</li>
<li>3 Tbsp sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp pizza seasoning</li>
<li>pepperoni and mozzarella cheese (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://jasonarends.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpid-IMG_20140105_105041.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-149" alt="wpid-IMG_20140105_105041.jpg" src="http://jasonarends.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpid-IMG_20140105_105041-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>make the bread in the exact same way as the white bread recipe referenced above.  when it comes time to roll up the dough into a loaf, first add pepperoni and cheese, then roll it.  i made one with the filling, one without.</p>
<p>during the first rise which should be 10-30 mins, i think i let it sit for about an hour.  i probably should have shortened it as something weird happened later.  after a proof of about 1.25 hours, which is shorter than usual for this bread, the un-filled loaf got all lumpy and holey.  i didn't notice when this happened, but my guess is that it somehow got over-proofed and started to deflate.</p>
<p>when it came time to bake, the un-filled one took the regular 25-30 mins, but the filled one took much longer to get up to 190-195 degrees.  i probably baked it an additional 15-20 minutes - measuring the internal temperature about every 5 mins.</p>

<p>haven't tried yet, but i'm guessing this would make a nice grilled cheese with mozzarella and pepperoni...</p>
