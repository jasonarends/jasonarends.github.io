<p>The fertilizing period is done, and since I was out of town last week, we waited one extra week and got our plants and planted them on Saturday (4/18). Sometime over a week ago, I got a couple soaker hoses and then re-arranged the bales so there wouldn't be any gaps - it turned into a big "S" shape. There were actually 2 bales that I had forgotten about on the side of the house that I included in the layout, but they were not part of the fertilization plan. I may start fertilizing them and plant something late in them.</p>
<p><a href="http://jasonarends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429401557877.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-174 size-large" src="http://jasonarends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429401557877-1024x768.jpg" alt="wpid-wp-1429401557877.jpg" width="604" height="453" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far the plants consist of: 3 varieties of tomato, 2 varieties of green bell pepper, red and white onions, strawberries, and parsley. I have potatoes that will be added into the middle of all the bales and I want to get more herbs to plant in the sides. I am also planning on getting one more tomato variety and there is one bale still unused - maybe garlic or something, I'll have to make a trip to the greenhouse and see what they have. I might see about planting a vine plant or two in the ends - pumpkins and cucumbers?</p>
<p>Maybe I can insert a table to illustrate the layout:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>white onions</strong></td>
<td><em>unused</em></td>
<td><em>unfertilized</em></td>
<td><em>unfertilized</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>red onions</strong></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>red onions</strong></td>
<td><strong>green peppers</strong></td>
<td><strong>green peppers</strong></td>
<td><strong>strawberries</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td><strong>white onions</strong><br />
<strong>parsley</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>tomatoes</strong></td>
<td><strong>tomatoes</strong></td>
<td><em>unused (tomatoes)</em></td>
<td><strong>roma tomatoes</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We also moved our compost - it was in a circular bin near our deck, but I thought it would work well to just pile it in the gaps between the S pattern of the bales, so we did. If we still live at this house next year, we should have a pretty good amount of compost and could even make a regular raised-bed garden. The bales will have decomposed by the fall and can get stirred into the compost, along with old vegetable matter.</p>
<p>That's it for now - hopefully potatoes (russet, red, and yellow) will be planted by EOD and maybe more herbs.</p>
